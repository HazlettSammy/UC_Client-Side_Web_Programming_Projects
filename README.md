This repository contains the projects I developed during the Client-Side Web Programming course, where I focused on JavaScript and its application in creating dynamic and interactive websites. Throughout the course, I learned how to write JavaScript applications using conditionals, loops, functions, and objects, manipulate the DOM, and create forms with data validation. I also explored building dynamic GUIs using industry-standard libraries and working with external data sources like JSON, XML, and text files. I used Visual Studio Code & Notepad++ for coding, and the course was based on Murachâ€™s JavaScript and jQuery (4th edition) as well as the optional A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript by Mark Myers for extra practice.
